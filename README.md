## Market Basket Analysis - Project Description

**Project Goal:** analyse an start-up portfolio and clientele to define if it would be an optimal partnership for our client. 
A market basket analysis is conducted to discover patterns in the start-up's transactional data that can provide insight into their actual performance.

Moreover, if the company was worth acquiring, the interesting relationships (or associations) found between customer’s transactions and the item(s) they’ve purchased, could then be used to drive sales-oriented initiatives such as recommender systems.


**Data characteristics:** CSV file that contains one month’s (30 days’ worth) of the start-up's online transactions and a file containing all the products that they currently sell.
